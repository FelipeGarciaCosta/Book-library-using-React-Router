# Book Library App with React Router
This is an example project designed to demonstrate how to use React Router for building dynamic and interactive web applications. In this project, a simple book library is implemented to showcase routing, navigation, and dynamic rendering using React Router.

# Disclaimer
This project was created as part of a React learning course that focuses on teaching key concepts of React Router. While I have made modifications and improvements to the original code, the project is based on examples and structures provided during the course.

I do not claim full authorship of the design, logic, or foundational ideas of this project, as it follows the guidelines taught by the course instructor. The shared code is for educational purposes only and should not be considered as a final product or for commercial use.

# Project Aims
This project aims to:

1) Learn how to use **React Router** to manage routing and navigation in a React app.
2) Understand concepts like dynamic routes, nested routes, and route parameters.

# Features
- üìö Display a library of books.
- üîó Navigation between pages using React Router.
- üõ†Ô∏è Dynamic routing to display individual book details.
- üß© Example of nested routes for enhanced navigation.

# Contributing
Special thanks to *Jannick Leismann* for providing the foundational knowledge and structure for this project. This project is shared as part of my learning journey in React.
Feel free to explore the code, add comments, or contribute by submitting pull/merge requests. Collaboration and feedback are always welcome! üòä

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
