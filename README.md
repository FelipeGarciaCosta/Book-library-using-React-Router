# Book Library App with React Router
This is an example project designed to demonstrate how to use React Router for building dynamic and interactive web applications. In this project, a simple book library is implemented to showcase routing, navigation, and dynamic rendering using React Router.

# Disclaimer
This project was created as part of a React learning course that focuses on teaching key concepts of React Router. While I have made modifications and improvements to the original code, the project is based on examples and structures provided during the course.

I do not claim full authorship of the design, logic, or foundational ideas of this project, as it follows the guidelines taught by the course instructor. The shared code is for educational purposes only and should not be considered as a final product or for commercial use.
